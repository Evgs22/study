			<div class="textpost1">One morning, when <strong>Gregor Samsa</strong>woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections.<br><br>The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pityfully thin compared with the size of the rest of him waved about helplessly as he loked. <strong>"Whats happened to me?"</strong>he thought. It wasn`t a dream.

		<div class="textpost1">if i didn`t have my parents to think about i`d have given in my notice a long time ago, i`d have gone up to the boss and told him just what i think, tell him everythink i would, let him know just what i feel. He`d fall right off his desk! And it`s a funny sort of business to be sitting up there at your desk, talking down at your subordinates from up there, especially when you have to go right up close becouse the boss is hard of hearing.<br>
			<br>Well, there`s still some hope; once i~ve got the money together to pay off my parents debt to him - another five or six years i suppose - that`s definety what i`ll do.

Gregor then tured to look out the window at the dull weather. Drops of rain could be heard hitting the pane, which made him feel quite sad.</p>
		<p class="text2">He must tried it a hungried times, sut his eyes so that he wouldn`t have to look at the floundering legs, and only stopped when he began to fell a mild, dull pain there that he had never felt before <strong>"Oh, God",</strong> he thought,<strong>"What a strenuous career it is hat I`ve chosen!"</strong> Travelling day in and day out.</p>
